## Git Version Control
- **Git** is a distributed **version control system** designed to track changes in source code during software development.
- **Git** allows multiple developers to **collaborate**, manage different versions, and merge their work seamlessly.
- **Git** enables efficient **code management**, fosters collaboration, and ensures the integrity and history of a projects development.

 1. **git init** - Initialize a new Git repository 
  2. **git add .** - Add files to the repository 
  3. **git commit -m 'first commit'** - Commit changes 
  4. **git branch -M main** - Create or rename the main branch 
  5. **git remote add origin {solution_name}.git** - Add a remote repository 
  6. **git push -u origin main** - Push changes to the main branch of the remote repository 
  7. **git remote add origin https://github.com/JoeEberle/{solution_name}/{solution_name}.git** - Add another remote repository
